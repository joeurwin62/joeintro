		<h1> Welcome to my Personal Introductions!</h1>
		<p>My favorite culture that I am not a part of would have to be European, I just think that the way they do things is very interesting.</p>
		<p>Two historical figures I relate to would have to be Jac Haudenscheild, who was a famous sprint car driver, I enjoy motorsports. As well as, Martin Luther, I just feel he had a lot of courage to do what he did, and I try to do everything with as much courage as possible. </p>
		<p> A meal that represents me would be baby back ribs, they are my favorite thing to cook. </p>
		<p> I feel most creative when I draw. </p>
